        <div id="about">Welcome!<br /><br />If you've already tried to do some of these puzzles, you might be thinking, "Isn't it a little harsh to assume everyone has experience in computer science, sound engineering, and digital design?"<br /><br />Yes, yes it is. <br /><br />However, I'm confident that given enough time, everyone can solve these puzzles. If you get stuck, maybe ask a friend, or try a totally different idea! A couple tips - the text of each puzzle does hint, at least a little bit, toward the solution. Make sure you read carefully, and maybe more than once. Some of these puzzles WILL REQUIRE third-party tools to complete - but it's up to you to pick them.<br /><br />-Jacob Guglielmin, Class of 2022</div>
