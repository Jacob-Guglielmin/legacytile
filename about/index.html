            Welcome!<br /><br />If you've already tried to do some of these
            puzzles, you might be thinking, "Isn't it a little harsh to assume
            everyone has experience in computer science, sound engineering,
            digital design, and steganography?"<br /><br />Yes, yes it is.
            <br /><br />However,I'm confident that given enough time, everyone
            can solve these puzzles. If you get stuck, maybe ask a friend, or
            try a totally different idea! A couple tips - the text each puzzle
            does hint, at least a little bit, toward the solution. Make sure you
            read carefully, and maybe more than once. <br /><br />-Jacob
